# Good Ideas for Open Source (Python) Development

Patrick Young

---

# Disclaimer

* I'm not an expert in open source Python development

* These are my options alone

* These are tools I've found useful; I'd really like to hear about others you like

---

# Why Open Source?

* Gain trust/mind share - developers are:

  1. **Paranoid** (they don't trust your black box)
  2. **Cheap** (hard to convince the powers that be to open up the check book)
  3. **Hate vendor lock-in**

* Good promotion for you and DigitalGlobe

  * Check out how many stars [MapBox's](https://github.com/mapbox) projects have (27 pages of repos!)
  * Happy developers are productive developers

* Encourages better code

  * Less apt to be sloppy if someone else can take peak
  * Discourages code bloat

* Lots of free tooling for you if you're project is open source (more coming)

---

# Write Good Documentation

* No one will use your package if it takes more than a second to figure out what it does

* [GitHub](https://github.com/github/markup) renders MarkDown and Restructured Text (and a bunch of others) in a README.md/rst for you!  Use this feature!  

  * A good place for the elevator pitch on your project, quick install instructions, etc

  * I don't think its a great place for all your documentation to be hosted...

---

# Write Good Documentation

* It is a pain to hand write your API documentation (time consuming, quickly out of date)

* Instead use [Sphinx](http://sphinx-doc.org/) (python.org's documentation is generated in this way)

  * I like to write my doc strings as in the [Google style guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html) and Sphinx renders them nicely automatically:

# Host Your Documentation Online

* Open source projects can use [Read the Docs](https://readthedocs.org/) for free hosting, here's an [example](http://tiletanic.readthedocs.org/en/latest/)

  * Awesome Sphinx integration, builds on every commit!

.center[![](images/rthed.png "Read the Docs")]

* Another options is [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/), integrates nicely with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/)

---

# Make Your Package Easily Installable

* No one wants to spend hours figuring out how to integrate your code into their project

* [Pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) is the tool of choice for installing Python projects (on PyPi or locally)
  * Included in recent versions of Python

* You make your package installable via a `setup.py` in your root directory

* Pretty straightforward for pure Python, things are more complicated if you build c extensions, etc.

* The [Python Packaging Authority](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/) is a great resource

---

# Make Your Package Easily Installable

A real example:

```python
import sys
from setuptools import setup, find_packages

open_kwds = {}
if sys.version_info > (3,):
    open_kwds['encoding'] = 'utf-8'

with open('README.rst', **open_kwds) as f:
    readme = f.read()

setup(name='tiletanic',
      version='0.0.4',
      description='Geospatial tiling utilities',
      long_description=readme,
      classifiers=[],
      keywords='',
      author='Patrick Young',
      author_email='patrick.young@digitalglobe.com',
      url='https://github.com/digitalglobe/tiletanic',
      license='MIT',
      packages=find_packages(exclude=['tests', 'docs']),
      include_package_data=True,
      install_requires=['shapely>=1.5']
      )

```

---

# Put Your Package in PyPi

* Canonical place for Python packages, lets you run 

.center[`pip install your-awesome-package`]

* Easy to do if you've got your `setup.py` in order ([a tutorial](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/distributing/#uploading-your-project-to-pypi))

  * There is a [test site](https://wiki.python.org/moin/TestPyPI) to practice on (you get one shot with a given version number on PyPi)

---

# Write Some Tests

* As your package grows, you will inevitably refactor

  * It's hard to know if you've broken something
  * Quite nice to have when installing in a new environment
  * Customers of your code will want to run them if something goes wrong


* I like [pytest](http://pytest.org/latest/) over the built in [unittest](https://docs.python.org/2/library/unittest.html) package

  * Has a great runner (will run unittest, nose, doctests in addition to pytest style)
  * Lots of built in magic (fixtures, temporary directory and file support, etc)

```python
def test_cover_geometry_multilinestring1(tiler, mls):
    """A MultiLineString geometry."""
    tiles = [tile for tile in cover_geometry(tiler, mls, 8)]
    assert len(tiles) == 4
    assert set(tiles) == {(127, 88, 8), (127, 89, 8), (128, 88, 8), (128, 89, 8)}
```

---

# Use Continuous Integration

* I like [travis](https://travis-ci.org/) and its free for open source!

* Just drop a `.travis.yml` file in your root directory and get an account:

```yaml
language: python

python:
  - "2.7"

before_install:
  - sudo add-apt-repository -y ppa:ubuntugis/ppa
  - sudo apt-get update -qq
  - sudo apt-get install -qq libgeos-dev python-numpy
  - pip install -r requirements-dev.txt

install:
  - pip install -e .

script: "py.test tests"  
```

* Supports much more than Python

---

# Use Continuous Integration

*  Travis runs on every commit and alerts you to success/failure with nice logs

.center[![](images/travis.png "travis")]

# Summary

For an open source Python package to be useful, I think one ought to:

1. Write good documentation (this is easy if you keep up on your doc strings)
2. Publish your documentation (A summary in GitHub, API docs in Read The Docs)
3. Make it easy to install your package (`setup.py` + pushing to PyPi)
4. Write some tests (100% coverage just for the sake of it is of dubious value)
5. Use continuous integration (lots of free options for open source)

**PS:**  I try to follow [PEP8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) standards, but I don't always get it write and it can be pain to fix.  Check out [Yapf](https://github.com/google/yapf) for an automatic solution!
